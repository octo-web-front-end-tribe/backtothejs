Eirik was the last Viking king of Northumbria (AD 947\u201348 and 952\u201354), and a rather colourful figure. He was the son of Harald Finehair, who according to later tradition was the first ruler of a united kingdom of Norway. Eirik earned his nickname by murdering several of his brothers in order to secure his succession to his father\u2019s throne. According to later sagas, Eirik was unpopular because of the cruelty of his wife Gunnhild. The people gave their support instead to Eirik's younger brother, H\u00e5kon the Good, who had been brought up in England.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEirik fled to England, and became king of Northumbria.  The centre of that kingdom was at York, which was probably the most important Viking town in England.  At first, Eirik probably ruled on behalf of the West Saxon dynasty, who by this time claimed kingship over the whole of England. However, Eirik fell out with his English overlords, and also faced attacks from a rival Viking dynasty in Dublin.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEirik spent much of his time out of Northumbria, raiding in Scotland and around the Irish Sea. He was also driven out of Northumbria at least twice, and following his death at the battle of Stainmore in 954, Northumbria was absorbed into the emerging kingdom of England.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEirik's coins reflect his changing relationship with the Anglo-Saxon dynasty in Wessex. His early coins have his name and title around a small cross, like Anglo-Saxon coins of the time. This later coin shows a Viking sword. The sword was the symbol of St Peter, and had earlier been used on Viking coins struck at York in the name of St Peter. However, it also symbolised warfare and conquest, and may reflect Eirik\u2019s struggles in his later years to hold Northumbria by force against his former overlords.

Having destroyed the Egyptian army in northern Syria, Nebuchadnezzar pushed south at least as far as southern Israel. In his fourth year, 601 BC, he seems to have marched on Egypt itself.

Unfortunately this tablet breaks off before the crucial events of 587 BC. But it does record the earlier stages. Judah had stopped paying tribute to Babylon. In 598 BC the Babylonian army besieged Jerusalem. It fell on 15/16th March 597 BC. King Jehoiachin of Judah was carried off to Babylon, along with heavy tribute. Tablets excavated at Babylon record rations issued to Jehoiachin and his sons, along with other 'guests' of the king.

They revere their ancestors and give great importance to funeral celebrations. From the early 1950s they became well-known for developing a new tradition of beautifully carved figurative coffins. This practice is said to have originated in Teshie, a fishing community in Accra. The earliest example was made in 1951 by two carpenters, Kane Quaye and his brother Ajetey, who made a coffin in the form of an aeroplane to bury their grandmother in 1951. This new style was successful in the community and Kane Quaye developed it further with his apprentice Paa Joe. Such artistic coffins have become very popular in Ghana and internationally.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGa coffins are made by specialist carpenters. The carpenter will first make a drawing following a brief from the deceased\u2019s relatives. Families commission coffins representing the life achievements or dreams of a deceased relative, or characterising their personality \u2013 designs include things such as an eagle, a car, a plane, a bible, a fish, or a camera. Sometimes the deceased will have prepared a design brief during his or her lifetime. Coffins are made of wood and then painted. The deceased's body is washed, dressed, adorned and laid out with the coffin open during the wake. The coffin is then closed and carried to the burial ground.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis coffin was made in the workshop of Paa Joe, who was trained by Kane Quaye.

The project later became known as Transforming Arms into Tools.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMozambicans were encouraged to hand over weapons in exchange for ploughs, bicycles and sewing machines. The weapons were then cut up and turned into imaginative sculptures by a group of artists working in Maputo, the capital of Mozambique.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Tree of Life is a war memorial in one sense, though it does not commemorate soldiers and politicians.

Sennacherib planned to transform the ancient city of Nineveh into a place that would astonish the civilized world. A system of canals and stone aqueducts brought water from forty or fifty miles to the parks, orchards and allotments of the city. This relief helps us to reconstruct ancient quarrying and building techniques. The stone was cut with great iron saws, which can be seen being carried by some of the workers on the relief. Examples of such saws have been excavated at Nimrud. The colossal figures (weighing up to sixteen tons) were roughed out to reduce their weight, but the final carving was done after it was set in position, as was done with the carved relief panels.", "relatedNodes": ["stone-lion-s-head", "stone-panels-from-the-north-palace-of-ashurbanipal-room-s-nos-1318", "stone-panel-from-the-north-west-palace-of-ashurnasirpal-ii-room-b-panel-20"], "audioClips": [{"thumbnailURL": "https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-brit-museum.appspot.com/audiothumbs/audio_artwork-05.svg", "identifier": "6QVyZqtaRUgQmWeSCoiscG", "mainURL": "https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-brit-museum.appspot.com/img/cb8e23ff27afbb282a780176a3a3a9d9657cd728.mp3", "content_type": "audio/mpeg", "media_kind": null}], "dateDiscovered": null, "lng": 43.164000399999964, "thumbnailURL": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/71bFSJQK5ya_J-U5WG_cg5iIrAWnXuDn8zEmPtK7qcXsYVpmPeK27CXrdnZ00FV_mSFxnTm5qdbH0l6fFO0iRgM7Rl2B=s256", "mainImageURL": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/71bFSJQK5ya_J-U5WG_cg5iIrAWnXuDn8zEmPtK7qcXsYVpmPeK27CXrdnZ00FV_mSFxnTm5qdbH0l6fFO0iRgM7Rl2B=s1024"}, {"zoomLevel": 5, "categoryName": "Living and dying", "bullet": "olduvai-handaxe", "subCultureName": "Lower Palaeolithic", "cultureName": "Africa", "images": [{"thumbnailURL": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1UfwafILy8MznwsSGp1G1nc9-Yzx40aG6z8g2tc1cPwvip9GQ6szn0A21cqRElVlUTkOb258MpR0kVDo6ET4tTGZ9qRB=s256", "identifier": "6Evt2uMeIgI2o44yYKowoI", "mainURL": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1UfwafILy8MznwsSGp1G1nc9-Yzx40aG6z8g2tc1cPwvip9GQ6szn0A21cqRElVlUTkOb258MpR0kVDo6ET4tTGZ9qRB=s1024", "content_type": "image/jpeg", "media_kind": null}], "title": "Olduvai handaxe", "youtubeVideo": null, "dateCreated": -1200000, "locationName": "Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania", "lat": -2.9895714, "descriptionHTML": "The first great invention, this tool is called a handaxe.

Afterwards, a fine metal tool was used to engrave a stipple outline around the design and to fill in the background in some areas. Finally, twenty-six shallow holes were drilled into the metal.

This poem presents an intimate, and strikingly dark, portrait; the king is speaking to his heir from the grave. Amenemhat was clearly not the actual author of the poem, which may have been \u2018ghost-written\u2019 sometime after his death. Some 700 years later, New Kingdom scribes attributed it to a master scribe called Khety.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story records a historical event which took place at the end of Amenemhat\u2019s reign about 1955 BC. The text insinuates that Amenemhat, the founder of the Twelfth Dynasty, was assassinated. The dead king appears to his son and successor in a dream and warns him to trust no one lest he too be betrayed. This particular sheet of the text begins in the middle of the old king's account of how he was attacked in the palace as he slept when the crown prince was not with him.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA colophon at the end of the poem names the teacher Qageb to whom the copyist Inena dedicated the manuscript. It is clear the teacher occasionally found faults with his pupil's hand; the signs written in the upper margin are the teacher's corrected forms of signs imperfectly copied by the scribe. As is typical of literary texts in hieratic, the handwritten adaptation of hieroglyphs, some groups of signs are written in red ink to indicate section or chapter headings. Also characteristic are the superscript dots called verse points, used to indicate the ends of lines.

It symbolised the Neo-Confucian ideals of purity and integrity.

What we do know is that they come from the Cyclades, islands in the Aegean Sea, where marble is plentiful.

Blood, as a powerful life substance, was an integral part of the cyclicality of time and the natural environment.

In this part of the island momentous changes took place around 2500 BC, perhaps precipitated by the arrival of refugees from southern Anatolia who were escaping from earlier catastrophes.
